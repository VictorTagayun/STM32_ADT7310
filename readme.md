# Interfacing [ADT7310](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/adt7310.pdf) to STM32 via SPI

[ADT7310](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/adt7310.pdf) is Analog Devices' Digital SPI Temperature Sensor with ±0.5°C accuracy and 16-bit ADC. Here we interface and program the ADT7310 but encountered hiccups along the way. In the end it was solved and hopefully it can help others too. So follow me along the way in interfacing to ADT7310.
