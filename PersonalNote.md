Personal Note:

The human brain is limitless and we, humans, have not explored its true potential like the Jedis.
Memory recall is quite tricky at times when you needed the information at that moment.
I have placed the projects/repository here on Github for that sole purpose.
Some may be fully documented some are partial and some are not.

We also search the internet for some solutions and answers to our problems.
Here maybe some of that.
I hope you find some useful and apply it to your projects, but please, read the disclaimer first.
